# TCP-Analyzer
**What's this?** 
This is a web TCP analyzer.
**What can it do?**
Read the .txt files saved by the wireshake and dynamically display the tcp creation process.(In fact, the animation is very rudimentary, and the ui is also unsightlyðŸ˜¢)Unfortunatelyï¼Œwireshake covers all its functions and does them better.So I prefer to recommend you to learn to use wireshake instead.ðŸ¤§
**Why is its code so bad?**
Because i am so bad.ðŸ¤§And because I tried to use native js and html without any frames.
**Will it be updated?**
Shortly it will be reconstructed with Vue.But now I'm still learning how to use Vue.
