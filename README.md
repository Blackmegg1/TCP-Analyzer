# TCP-Analyzer
**What's this?** 

This is a web TCP analyzer.

**What can it do?**

Read the .txt files saved by the wireshake and dynamically display the tcp creation process.(In fact, the animation is very rudimentary, and the ui is also unsightlyðŸ˜¢)Unfortunatelyï¼Œwireshake covers all its functions and does them better.So I prefer to recommend you to learn to use wireshake instead
